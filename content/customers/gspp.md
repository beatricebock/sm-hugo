This is to confirm that we have been happy with SandFil implementation since the implementation was done in year 2007.

My team and I have been in contact with the research and development team in order to complete new installations for our career job portal and some ongoing upgrades. Throughout the project, the SandFil team was willing to go the extra mile to meet our needs and diligent in carrying out the work and solving issues.

With the continued support, we certainly hope to continue to grow by utilizing SandFil's products and services.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,  
For GS Paper & Packaging Sdn Bhd
