In many organizations, employees fail to see how their work contributes to achieving the objectives of the company. Instead, departments, teams, and individuals focus on different things, on what the boss tells them is important or the company decides to target that year or the latest problem needing to be fixed. Rather than pulling together toward shared goals, they are pulled apart by shifting priorities and diverging objectives.

One of the distinguishing characteristics of our solution is how well it aligns people, plans, and processes with the mission and vision of the organization. Every department, team, and individual not only knows what the mission and vision are, but they also understand what they must do to support them. The connection between an employeeâ€™s work and the mission and vision of his/her organization is documented and measurable.
