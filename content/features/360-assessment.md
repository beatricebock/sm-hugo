## What is a 360 Assessment?
The SandFil 360 Assessment is ideal for obtaining feedback for leadership development programs or as part of Performance Appraisal. It is where employees receive confidential and anonymous ratings and feedback from the people who work around them, such as employee's manager, peers, and direct reports.

## How will the 360 Assessement help my company?
360 Assessment helps to increases Self-awareness as the feedback report gives the employee and company insight into their behaviour and strengths, and how they are perceived by others in the organization. This all-round assessment uncovers blind spots and provides a balanced view of their skills and behaviors, giving employees a starting point for their personal development.
