We recognize the importance of ongoing monitoring and timely feedback on employees’ behavior and performance.

We recommend the use of Merit Points to recognize and reward the employees’ performance achievements. This also allows the employees to benchmark their performance within the organization.

With the Merit Point system, the year end appraisal KPI will be calculated automatically for review purposes. This makes the year end appraisal simple and effective.
